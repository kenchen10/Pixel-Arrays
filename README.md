# Pixel-Arrays
A tool written in Processing for analyzing cellular automata. This program can display cellular automata with 3 and 5 neighbors. It also continually adds to a database of rules based on properties such as whether the pattern looks like a checkerboard or if it looks lined. Users can add patterns to an uninteresting database to filter patterns that are interesting. Also allows for non-random initial conditions. https://youtu.be/-ul-bqH1fmw
